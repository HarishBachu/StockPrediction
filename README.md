# StockPrediction
A Comparative study on Traditional and Deep Learning based Stock Prediction Algorithms

We have used Traditional Predictive models like Moving Average as a benchmark accuracy. Using this, we tested and compared 3 different Prediction Algorithms: a normal LSTM network, an LSTM coupled with EWT decomposition, and an Autoencoder model.
